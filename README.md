This is a template to start building math-rich websites effortlessly.

Ancient Greeks placed large vessels named _kraters_ at the center of the room during a symposium.
An elected _symposiarch_ would oversee the event by deciding the dilution of the wine in the krater and timing refills.
Meanwhile, other _symposyasts_ drank, talked, and enjoyed any pleasure the evening offered.

I hope this affords you to reproduce that, with ideas instead of wine.

## Getting started

1. Click [`Use this template`][krater-generate-url] here or at the top of this page.
2. Pick a name for your new repo and create it.
3. Wait for the first build to become green; you can observe its status at `> Actions > Publish`.
4. Enable GitHub Pages on branch `gh-pages` and folder `/`; you can reach the configuration panel at `> Settings > Pages`.

That's it! Your website is now visible at `https://<USER_NAME>.github.io/<REPO_NAME>/`

You can now start building it just like any other [Jekyll][jekyll-url] website.
