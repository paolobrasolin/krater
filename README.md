This is a template to start building math-rich websites effortlessly.

Ancient Greeks placed large vessels named _kraters_ at the center of the room during a symposium.
An elected _symposiarch_ would oversee the event by deciding the dilution of the wine in the krater and timing refills.
Meanwhile, other _symposyasts_ drank, talked, and enjoyed any pleasure the evening offered.

I hope this affords you to reproduce that, with ideas instead of wine.
